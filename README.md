A secret project @Robert-Shen and I are working on together. More details to come.

some UI ideas in react native (out of google first page)

NativeBase: https://nativebase.io/
It gives you a prototype with full codes in a click. Very sick.

Shoutem ui toolkit: https://shoutem.github.io/ui/
Pretty, instagrammable, easy-coding ui design. They also provide theme and animation.
